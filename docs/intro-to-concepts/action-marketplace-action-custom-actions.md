### Action: Marketplace Action, Custom Actions (Composite Action)

An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task. Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files. 

An action can pull your git repository from GitHub, set up the correct toolchain for your build environment, or set up the authentication to your cloud provider.

You can write your own actions, or you can find actions to use in your workflows in the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions).

For more information, see [Creating actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions).
