### The Developer Loop: Writing, Testing, Debugging

Writing a workflow file is as simple as creating a `.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

To test your workflow file you will push it to your repository and navigate to the Actions tab to see the status of your workflow run.

When the workflow run is complete you can view the logs of each step to see what happened.
