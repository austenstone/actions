# GitHub Actions Best Practices

This document outlines best practices for GitHub Actions based on the patterns demonstrated in this repository.

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Design

### Structure and Organization
- **Use descriptive workflow names** with consistent numbering/prefixes
- **Group related steps** into logical jobs
- **Keep workflows focused** on a single purpose
- **Use meaningful job and step names** that clearly indicate their purpose

### Event Triggers
- **Be specific with triggers** to avoid unnecessary runs
- **Use path filters** to trigger only when relevant files change
- **Combine multiple trigger types** for comprehensive automation
- **Use workflow_dispatch** for manual testing and debugging

### Job Dependencies
- **Use `needs`** to create proper job dependencies
- **Minimize dependencies** to maximize parallelization
- **Use conditional execution** (`if`) to skip unnecessary jobs
- **Share data between jobs** using outputs and artifacts

## üîß Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
```yaml
- uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      ~/.cache/pip
      ~/.gradle/caches
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-deps-
```

### Matrix Builds
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
    node-version: [16, 18, 20]
  fail-fast: false  # Continue other jobs if one fails
```

### Conditional Execution
```yaml
- name: Deploy to production
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
```

### Resource Management
- **Use appropriate runner types** (ubuntu-latest is fastest/cheapest)
- **Cache dependencies** to speed up builds
- **Use build matrices** for parallel execution
- **Set timeouts** to prevent runaway jobs

## üîí Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
- **Never hardcode secrets** in workflow files
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for sensitive data
- **Scope secrets appropriately** (repository vs environment)
- **Rotate secrets regularly**

### Action Security
- **Pin action versions** to specific commits or tags
- **Review third-party actions** before using
- **Use official actions** when available
- **Keep actions updated** but test before upgrading

### Permission Management
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
  packages: write
  id-token: write  # For OIDC
```

### OIDC Authentication
```yaml
- name: Configure AWS credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: ${{ secrets.AWS_ROLE_ARN }}
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

## üöÄ Deployment Practices

### Environment Strategy
- **Use environment protection rules** for production
- **Implement approval workflows** for critical deployments
- **Use environment-specific secrets** and variables
- **Test in staging** before production deployment

### Rollback Capability
- **Plan for rollback scenarios** in deployment workflows
- **Keep previous versions** accessible
- **Implement health checks** post-deployment
- **Use blue-green or canary deployments** for zero-downtime

### Artifact Management
```yaml
- name: Upload artifacts
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: build-artifacts-${{ github.sha }}
    path: dist/
    retention-days: 30
```

## üß™ Testing Integration

### Test Strategy
- **Run tests early** in the workflow
- **Use test matrices** for multiple environments
- **Separate unit and integration tests**
- **Generate test reports** and upload artifacts

### Quality Gates
- **Fail fast** on test failures
- **Require status checks** for merge protection
- **Use quality thresholds** (coverage, security scans)
- **Block deployments** on test failures

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

### Logging Best Practices
- **Use descriptive log messages** with consistent formatting
- **Include context** (commit SHA, environment, version)
- **Use emojis** for visual scanning (as shown in demos)
- **Log important decisions** and their reasoning

### Workflow Summaries
```yaml
- name: Create summary
  run: |
    echo "## üöÄ Deployment Summary" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "- **Version**: ${{ github.sha }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "- **Environment**: production" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "- **Status**: ‚úÖ Success" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

### Status Checks
```yaml
- name: Update commit status
  uses: actions/github-script@v7
  with:
    script: |
      github.rest.repos.createCommitStatus({
        owner: context.repo.owner,
        repo: context.repo.repo,
        sha: context.sha,
        state: 'success',
        description: 'Deployment completed',
        context: 'deploy/production'
      })
```

## üîÑ Custom Actions

### Composite Actions
- **Group related steps** into reusable actions
- **Use clear input/output definitions**
- **Include proper documentation**
- **Version your actions** appropriately

### JavaScript Actions
- **Use TypeScript** for better maintainability
- **Include comprehensive tests**
- **Handle errors gracefully**
- **Follow semantic versioning**

### Docker Actions
- **Use minimal base images** (alpine, scratch)
- **Run as non-root user**
- **Include health checks**
- **Optimize for security**

## üìã Maintenance

### Workflow Maintenance
- **Review workflows regularly** for optimization opportunities
- **Update actions** to latest versions
- **Clean up unused workflows** and artifacts
- **Monitor workflow performance** and costs

- **Test updates** in development environments
- **Monitor security advisories**
- **Pin critical dependencies**

## üí° Advanced Patterns

### Workflow Orchestration

- **Create reusable workflows** for common patterns
- **Use matrix strategies** for complex scenarios

### Dynamic Workflows
